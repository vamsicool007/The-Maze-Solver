# The-Maze

Hi! and Welcome to The Maze. This is a piece of work which will help you to visualize graphs in a better way. I had fun building it and had learned a lot hope so do you. I hope you enjoy it.https://zaidxdxd.github.io/The-Maze-/. 


**Algorithm Used To Solve The Maze**

- [Depth-First-Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Breadth-First-Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- [Left Wall Follower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm#Wall_follower)
- [Right Wall Follower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm#Wall_follower)
- [A star Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
  
**Algorithm Used To Create Maze**

 - [Depth-First-Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
 - [Binary Tree](https://hurna.io/academy/algorithms/maze_generator/binary.html)
 - [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
 
 You can also create ranom walls through you mouse. Just click anywhere on the Maze and drag your mouse around. 
 
 You can drag the start and target point around in the same way.
 
 Changing the number of rows and columns are also a choice.
 
 
 Enjoy!
